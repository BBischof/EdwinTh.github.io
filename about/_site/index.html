<p>I am statistician turned data scientist, now working at Rabobank. I am a true data junkie, I just love to play around with data. After doing bachelor programs in psychology and history I completed the <a href="http://en.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/statistical-science-for-the-life-and-behavioural-sciences/en/introduction">Statistical Science</a> program at Leiden University, at which I <a href="https://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/scripties/MasterThoen.pdf">completed my MSc</a> with professor Hein Putter. From the moment I started R programming I was hooked, and it always remained my weapon of choice. However I try to keep an open mind and keep exploring other tools as well. Besides data analysis</p>

<p>My current interests are building Bayesian statistical models, building beatiful and functional Shiny apps, understandig and applying Deep Learning and the prediction of (very) rare events. Furthermore I hope to further develop as programmer. If you like to correspond about any of these topics of other things mentioned in one of the blogs I would love to hear from you.</p>

<p>Besides a data junkie and R programmer I am also a bit of foodie, an enthuastic albeit not overly talented tennis player, a coffee and wine lover, a sports buff and an avid traveller.</p>
